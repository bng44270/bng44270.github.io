A simple application for multi-factor authentication, written in HTML using
jQuery Mobile, jsSHA, LocalStorage and Application Cache. It implements the 
TOTP  (Time-Based One-Time Password) algorithm according to [RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)
 and has been tested to work with Google Authenticator, Dropbox, Dreamhost,
 Amazon, Linode, Okta and many other services.

Hosting
-------

To self-host a version of this application you can do so by just serving the files using Apache or nginx. For easy deployment, there is also a server.js node application which can be hosted from a nodejs 0.10-based container. This has been tested on Heroku/Dokku and OpenShift.

An experimental package for deployment on a local machine is available from [packager.io](https://packager.io/gh/gbraad/gauth/).
